## Unique Feature 1
#### In this project, the focal point revolves around administrative functionalities. The administrator has the capability to oversee and manage various aspects, including trainer bookings and payments. The system is designed to showcase pertinent information for both trainers and members. When a trainer logs in, the interface will prominently display details related to their booked sessions and received payments for the given year. On the other hand, for members, the system will present a summary of their attended sessions and any associated payments. Additionally, the admin possesses the flexibility to perform a wide range of tasks beyond the core functionalities, providing a comprehensive and dynamic administrative experience.
